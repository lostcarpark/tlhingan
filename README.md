# tlhingan mu' tu' - Klingon Word Finder

This is a very simple React app to assist with word puzzles in Klingon.

The JavaScript/React code is almost entirely in `App.js` for simplicity. It might make sense to split into multiple components.

Words are filtered according to criteria specified.

This is based on my [Word Finder app](https://github.com/lostcarpark/wordfinder).

This makes use of the [Klingon word project](https://github.com/PanderMusubi/klingon) from Pander Musubi.

It also uses the [Klingon pIqaD HaSta](https://www.evertype.com/fonts/tlh/) font designed by Mike Neff and updated by Michael Everson, released under the Open Font Licence.
